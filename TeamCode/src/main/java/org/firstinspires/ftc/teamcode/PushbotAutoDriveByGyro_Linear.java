/**
 * This file illustrates the concept of driving a path based on Gyro heading and encoder counts.
 * It uses the common Pushbot hardware class to define the drive on the robot.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * The code REQUIRES that you DO have encoders on the wheels,
 *   otherwise you would use: PushbotAutoDriveByTime;
 *
 *  This code ALSO requires that you have a Modern Robotics I2C gyro with the name "gyro"
 *   otherwise you would use: PushbotAutoDriveByEncoder;
 *
 *  This code requires that the drive Motors have been configured such that a positive
 *  power command moves them forward, and causes the encoders to count UP.
 *
 *  This code uses the RUN_TO_POSITION mode to enable the Motor controllers to generate the run profile
 *
 *  In order to calibrate the Gyro correctly, the robot must remain stationary during calibration.
 *  This is performed when the INIT button is pressed on the Driver Station.
 *  This code assumes that the robot is stationary when the INIT button is pressed.
 *  If this is not the case, then the INIT should be performed again.
 *
 *  Note: in this example, all angles are referenced to the initial coordinate frame set during the
 *  the Gyro Calibration process, or whenever the program issues a resetZAxisIntegrator() call on the Gyro.
 *
 *  The angle of movement/rotation is assumed to be a standardized rotation around the robot Z axis,
 *  which means that a Positive rotation is Counter Clock Wise, looking down on the field.
 *  This is consistent with the FTC field coordinate conventions set out in the document:
 *  ftc_app\doc\tutorial\FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
